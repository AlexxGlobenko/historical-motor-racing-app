This React Native app shows historical motor racing data.

The data is pulled from Ergast Developer API in the JSON format.

There is pagination implemented for the racers table so it only loads data for one particular page only.

Upon a click on a racerâ€™s name, detailed information about a racer is displayed.

To run app

```npm i```
then

```react-native run-ios```

   or
   
```react-native run-android```
